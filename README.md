# DWD Precipitation

This custom component for Home Assistant provides detailed precipitation forecasts and historical precipitation values from the past for Germany.


The data is derived from the radar based *Radvor* and *Radolan* products provided by the DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst) allowing you to track rain events at your precise location. 

Ideal for automations and warnings of severe precipitation events.
